## About the project
https://duegatti.pythonanywhere.com/

Due Gatti is a full stack application for web and mobile. It was built to a well-known neighbourhood store. With the beginning of the pandemic, there was a need for innovation as the store had to keep their doors closed. The website was built with Django Framework (Python) as back-end and VueJS (Javascript) as front-end, relying on Stripe for online payments.
